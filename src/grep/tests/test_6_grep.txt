What is your idea

                                   of a Parisian woman?

A jeweled beauty

                               with a gemmed hand?

Don't try to fancy!

                                Life is more gloomy!

The Parisian I know

                                   is nothing of the kind.



I don't know

                     whether she is old

                                                       or young,

In a gloss of finery

                                   impaired by wear

She works

                  at the toilet of a restaurant

A little restaurant

                               called

                                           Grande  Chamiere.

After having a drop

                                    one may have a desire

To refresh oneself

                                by taking the air.

The woman"s job

                               is to help with a towel,

And she is a conjurer

                                        in this affair.



You sit at the mirror

                                    in the toilet-room

Watching your pimples

                                          while she,

                                                             with a smile,

Will powder your face

                                          and put some perfume,

Wipe up the pool

                                and give you a towel.



To please the gluttons

                                        she sticks around

In the somber lavatory

                                         all day long.

For fifty centimes!

                                 (Which is around

Four kopecks

                         for every good turn).



I go to the washstand

                                        to wash my hands

Inhaling the marvel

                                    of perfumery smell,

Her wretched plainness

                                          puzzling my fancy

I want to say

                        to the mademoiselle:



Your appearance

                              is far from being pleasing.

Why should you spent your life

                                                          in a toilet?

I must have thought

                                    too much

                                                       of Parisians

Or

      you are not

                          a Parisian at all.



Your manners are languid

                                               and you look unhealthy.

The stockings you wear

                                            aren't silk but plain.





Why don't

                    the  moneyed messieurs

                                                                 present you

With bunches of violets

                                             now and then?



She didn't reply.

                             The air being rent

By a loud street noise

                                       falling

                                                   on us

That was the noise

                                  of the carnival merriment

Of young Parisians

                                  in Monte Parnasse.



I am sorry

                  for a rigorous poem like this,

For having mentioned

                                        a dirty pool,

But it's hard

                       for a woman to live

                                                          in Paris

If she has to work, -

                                       not to sell her soul.
